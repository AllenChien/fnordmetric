Wiki
====

  The FnordMetric core deals with processing data. There are two basic concepts:
  events and gauges.

  An Event is a piece of data that is sent to FnordMetric through one of the various
  sources. This event is a JSON Object / Hash with almost no constraints on the schema.

  A Gauge is a primitive data store for a numerical value over time (basically a counter
  with history). Gauges can be used in different modes like sum, average, max/min, etcetara.

  You write event handlers in ruby that get invoked per incoming event and modify (increment,
  set, etcetera) gauges.

  FnordMetric offers ways to display these gauges:

  FnordMetric Embed (recommended): FnordMetric Embed is a JavaScript library that provides a HTML5 API
  which lets you plugin realtime data and timeseries graphs into any webpage without having
  to write any code. This gives you a lot of flexiblitiy as you can control the complete
  layout and style with HTML and CSS. You can FnordMetric Embed as a white label solution
  to power your customer analytics apps.

  FnordMetric Frontend: FnordMetric Frontend is a ruby driven web interface for FnordMetric. It offers
  a ruby DSL and a collection of UI widgets to define custom dashboards. You can also write your own
  widgets or views on top of a ruby api.


  FnordMetric Core

    > disambiguation: Concepts
    > quick start

    > sending data 
      - _type, _time field mandatory
      - tcp, udp, redis, http, amqp, stomp
      - events containing user data (_session, _name)
      - _namespace

    > running fnordmetric
      - standalone
      - standalone w/ multiple workers
      - configuration options

    > event handlers
      - data, time, session etc methods
      - storing data in the session
      - end-of-session callback

   > gauge api
     - two vs three dimensional
     - incr, incr_field etc.
