  FnordMetric is a framework for collecting and displaying timseries data. It is split up into
  three components:


  FnordMetric UI
  --------------

  FnordMetric UI is a HTML5 / JavaScript API that lets you plugin realtime data and timeseries
  graphs into any webpage without having to write a single line of code. It gives you maximum
  flexiblitiy as you can control the complete layout and style with HTML and CSS. FnordMetric UI
  uses WebSockets to communicate with the backend. There are two backend implementations:
  FnordMetric Classic (ruby + redis) or FnordMetric Enterprise (JVM). You can use FnordMetric UI
  as a white label solution to power your custom realtime analytics apps.


  FnordMetric Classic
  -------------------

  FnordMetric Classic offers a ruby DSL for processing data streams and manipulating gauges that
  get stored in redis. It includes a collection of pre-made UI widgets which you can use to build
  beautiful web dashboards within minutes. You can also use the FnordMetric UI HTML5 API to display
  the data on another website or build highly customized / white label views.


  FnordMetric Enterprise
  ----------------------

  FnordMetric Enterprise is a JVM based timeseries database which serves as a backend for FnordMetric
  UI. It does not offer it's own user interface.



  The basic concept in FnordMetric is called a "gauge". A Gauge is a primitive data store for a numerical value over
  time. A gauge has two dimensions: Value und Time. Gauges can be used in different modes like sum,
  average, max/min, etcetara.

  The FnordMetric core deals with processing data. There are two basic concepts:
  events and gauges.

  An Event is a piece of data that is sent to FnordMetric through one of the various
  sources. This event is a JSON Object / Hash with almost no constraints on the schema.

  You write event handlers in ruby that get invoked per incoming event and modify (increment,
  set, etcetera) gauges.

  FnordMetric Enterprises

    > getting started

    > http api

    > other data sourcs
      - stomp


  FnordMetric Classic

    > getting started

    > sending data 
      - _type, _time field mandatory
      - tcp, udp, redis, http, amqp, stomp
      - events containing user data (_session, _name)
      - _namespace

    > running fnordmetric
      - standalone
      - standalone w/ multiple workers
      - configuration options

    > event handlers
      - data, time, session etc methods
      - storing data in the session
      - end-of-session callback

   > gauge api
     - two vs three dimensional

  > custom dashboards
    - overview
   - incr, incr_field etc.
