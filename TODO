You can run it as a standalone timerseries database or as a network of distributed
data collection agents. SQL Syntax, statsd support, c++, bindings for x,z,y jadda

-> Concepts: Stream, Agents vs Server, Retention Policy

-> functions: sum, avg, percentile, mean, variance, stddev, delta, nth_derivate,
              holtwinters

-> msync safety mode: relaxed (consistent but might loose data), conservative
                      (msync async) and paranoid (msync sync)

-> implicit fields: time, agent, offset

-> UI menu: query / streams
-> streams: local/remote. disk usage, replication status, retention, etc
-> query ui: tabs for: html req equivalent, html embed, etc
-> query safety mode: on/off (check row checksums)
-> malloc page manager
-> example:
  * getting started standalone:
     * create http_reqs stream with statuscode, count
     * select select http error rate
  * getting started distributed
     * agents have metrics with http req time distribution and url
     * graph global req time distribution
     * graph 90th percentile req time per agent
-> renice query threads in agents?
-> annotations / deploy lines?
-> push query down into backend
-> drop-in statsd adapter :)
-> agents that run queries on external data sources (e.g. logfiles)
-> newrelic-like agents that auto-export streams on demand
-> on demand streams :)
-> nagios adapter for alerting
-> http interface? (need to bundle lotsa resources)
-> query cache! :)
-> stream replication
-> optimized for seeks over time ranges
-> row compression / page compression?
-> interactive query UI generates embed html snippets
-> generate embed snippets from ruby api -> rails helper plugin
-> execute multiple queries in parallel in the ui -> get multiple timeseries
   and tables (tabs)
